    methods or variables from child classes

    iii)For "public" and "protected" access modifiers, there is no issue in "inheritance".
        For "default" access modifier, if the child and parent class are in the same package inheritance is possible,
        but if the child and parent class are in different packages inheritance is impossible

       For "private" access modifier, inheritance is impossible

       iv) "HAS-A" means "from parent to child, "Is-A" means "from child to parent
