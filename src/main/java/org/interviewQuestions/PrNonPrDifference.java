       There are two types of data type in Java

       1)Primitive data types==> byte < short < int < long < float < double ==> numaric primitive data types

       2) Non-Primitive data types ==> String==> used for multiple different characters storage inside an object

       String str= "Tom Hanks 123)?";

                        ********      INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS    ***********

       What are the differences between "Primitive" and "Non-Primitive" data types?
        1) "Non-Primitive" data is stored in Heap Memory, "Primitive" data is stored in Stack Memory
        2) "Non-Primitive" data types are infinitely many, but "Primitive" data types are just 8
        3) "Non-Primitive" data types can be created by Java and Java Developers, but "Primitive" data types
           can be created just by Java
        4) "Non-Primitive" data type names start with upper-cases, "Primitive" data type names use just lower-cases

        *5) "Non-Primitive" data types have
                                           i) Value
                                           ii) Methods in them
           "Primitive" data types have
                                          i) Value

     There are 2 types of memory in Java.
     1)Stack memory==> 1) Primitive data 2) References(address) of Non-Primitive data types are stored

     2)Heap memory ==> Stores Non-Primitive data types/values
